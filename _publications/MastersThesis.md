The work focuses on development and validation of a simulation platform for Robotis OP3 robot with MuJoCo. The work includes frequency syncing for controller that work in a non-factor frequency of the simulator. Additionally, to make the simulator compatible with sparse trajectory generation framework, we rediscritize the trajorctory to obtain trajectory points required for the simulator's working frequency.
