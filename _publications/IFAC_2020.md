excerpt: 'Continuing the work from Collision-Free Multi Robot Trajectory Optimization in Unknown Environments using Decentralized Trajectory Planning, in this paper we propose a trajectory optimization framework where we estimate the trajectories of the other robotis as a polynomial function of time hence accounting for tentative collision zones that should be avoided by the ego while planning the trajectory.'

Continuing the work from "Collision-Free Multi Robot Trajectory Optimization in Unknown Environments using Decentralized Trajectory Planning", in this paper we propose a trajectory optimization framework where we estimate the trajectories of the other robotis as a polynomial function of time hence accounting for tentative collision zones that should be avoided by the ego.
