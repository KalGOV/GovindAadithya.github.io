Built an Inverse kinematic-based algorithm for a Humanoid walkcycle leveraging the concept of Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and generated a smooth trajectory for the swing phase.

For practical use and deployment, this was coupled with PID controller on the ankle to increase the stability of the bot when there is only one contact point.
