Built an Inverse kinematic-based algorithm for a Humanoid walkcycle leveraging the concept of Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and generated a smooth trajectory for the swing phase.

For practical use and deployment, this was coupled with a PID controller on the ankle to increase the stability of the bot when there is only one contact point.
