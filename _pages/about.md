I'm a recent graduate from New York University with a Master of Science degree in Mechatronics and Robotics. I'm currently working as a Research Affiliate at the [Applied Dynamics and Optimization Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/adol/) (ADOL) collaborating with [Dr. Joo H. Kim](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/joo-h-kim). I'm currently working on developing a data capture and state estimation pipeline using VICON for our Robotis OP3 humanoid robot. Parallely, I'm also working on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based control strategies for task-based locomotion to expose myself to state-of-the-art DRL strategies. Previously, at ADOL, I worked on my [Master's thesis]() focusing on building a simulation platform with MuJoCo for Robotis OP3 robot that can be integrated with the Robotis' ROS framework and sparse trajectory generation frameworks and control cycle syncing for better sim2real transfer.  

I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechatronics Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRM University), India. During this period, I was part of a student research group SRM Team Humanoid where we worked on many projects intending to participate in the Robogames competition representing India on an international scale. We participated thrice when I was a core team member and won several medals.  

I love building autonomous systems and making them capable of making their own decisions by understanding their surroundings. This drove me to explore the field of Industrial Automation during my time at Schneider Electric India Pvt. Ltd. Here, I worked on multiple automation projects, both hardware-based and software-based, that were aimed at reducing mundane and repetitive tasks. These setups also performed tasks like product testing and data recording, which are crucial for the manufacturing facility. During this span, I worked with robots like Yaskawa GP-7 (6 Axis Manipulator) and Omron E-Cobra 800 (SCARA Manipulator) for material handling in work cells. I got exposure to concepts like the Industrial Internet of Things(IIoT), various communication protocols, data visualization, and data-driven decision-making processes. I also got to test the waters of the data science field while working on data-powered supply chain projects.

Something I'm passionate about apart from the above-mentioned is teaching and sharing knowledge. This was something that I found out when I was mentoring the newer teammates during my sophomore year and have kept up with it since. I'm currently a FIRST Robotics mentor at Poly Prep High school, mentoring the robotics club there as a part of NYU's initiative to promote STEM education among the underrepresented. I took up a summer role in the K12 Center at NYU as an Instructor for the Design, Invent, and Innovate(DII) program.
