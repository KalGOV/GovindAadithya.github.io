I'm currently pursuing Master of Science degree in Mechatronics and Robotics student at New York University.

I love building autonomous systems and making them capable of taking their own decisions by understanding their surroundings. This drove me to explore the field of Industrial Automation during my time at Schneider Electric India Pvt. Ltd. Here, I worked on multiple automation projects that aimed are reduction of mundane and repeatitive tasks. These setups also performed tasks like product testing and data recording which is a crucial part of a manufacturing facility. During this span, I worked with robots like Yaskawa GP-7 (6 Axis Manipulator) and Omron E-Cobra 800 (SCARA Manipulator) for material handling in workcell. 

I completed my Bachelor's of Technology in Mechatronics Engineer at SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRM University), India. During this period, I was a part of a student research group SRM Team Humanoid where we worked on many projects with the goal of participating in the Robogames competition representing India. We participated thrice when I was a core team member and won several medals.  

Something I'm passionate about apart form the above mentioned is teaching and sharing knowledge. This was something that I found out when I was mentoring in the team during my sophomore year and have kept up with it since. I'm currently a FIRST Robotics mentor at Poly Prep High school, mentoring the robotics club there as a part of NYU's K12 initiative to promote STEM education among the underrepresented.
