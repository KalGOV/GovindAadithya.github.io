About the project
===
As a part of curriculum project for Advance Mechatronics (ROB-GY 6103) at NYU Masters of Mechatronics and Robotics, we were to make an AGV that is capable of exploring a pre-defined shopfloor layout with dynamic obstacles and locate widgets and navigate to it's end postion as a Proof of Concept of transporting the payload in industrial situation.

The main highlight of the project is the implementation of Dynamic A-Star algorithm that is capable of path planning in precence of dynamic obstacles. The A-Star algorithm was written in embedded C.
