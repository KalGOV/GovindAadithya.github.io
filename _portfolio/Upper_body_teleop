About the project
===
The project aimed in building a robotic human upper body and give it the ability to be operated remotely. The potential applications include emergency response, remote inspection and monitoring in hazardous places, pandemic response, etc.

The robot's movements are controlled by a human from a remote place by extracting the joint angles of an operator standing in front of an RGBD Camera. These joint angles are fed to the robot to replicate the human motion as closely as possible. 
In order to give the realtime update of the robot's side to the operator to close the loop, a camera mounted on the humanoid transfers a live feed through a VR Headset to the user. This way, we can virtually give the user the experience of being in the moment while doing the teleoperation.
