About the project
===
This was a project made for WAT Consult post our participation in the BITS ATMOS'16. The requirement was a humanoid robot that can be used as a chatbot. The project was sponsored and the bot was completely 3D printed with Dynamixel AX-12A motors.

The robot performed basic activities like walking, splits, waving, etc. apart from the chatbot mode. For the chatbot mode, we used a set of predetermined questions and answers as requested and programmed the robot to pick keywords from text and speech and answer specific questions through text (on the system terminal) and via audio output (Text to Speach).
