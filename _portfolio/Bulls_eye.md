About the project
===
At Srujana, LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, we worked on making innovative eyecare products with the potential of providing eye-care to most rural areas. This project is one such, aligned with the institution's goals, and worked on making an alternative pre-screening device to identify any corneal irregularities.
The project take in images from the phone camera as per the instructions and is analyzed to build a surface map of the cornea to detect any irregularities in the curvature.

This was done by transforming the projection of the circles on a sphere to the surface of a cone, thereby creating a corneal projector that projects a pre-defined pattern. Since the pattern is known and the ideal outcome (cornea's radius of curvature) is known, we can deduce the changes on the corneal surface by inspecting the thickness and radius of the rings throughout the projection. The projected pattern was captured using a mobile phone camera and analyzed via an image processing algorithm to deduce the variation in projections and create a topography map of the cornea.
