About the project
===
At Srujana, LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, we worked on making innovative eyecare products with the potential of providing eye-care to most rural areas. This project is one such, aligned with the institution's goals and worked on making an alternative pre-screening device to identify any corneal irregularities.
The project take in images from the phone camera as per the instructions, and is analysed to build a surface map of the cornea to detect any irregularities on the curvature.

This was done through transforming the projection of circle on a sphere to a surface of a cone, thereby creating a pacornealThe objectivettern projector. Since the pattern is known and the ideal outcome (cornea's radius of curvature) is known, we can deduce the changes on the corneal surface by inspecting the thiccreatingkness and radius of the rings throughout the projection. The projected pattern was captured using a mobile phone camera and analyzed via an image processing algorithm to deduce the variation in projection and creat the corneal topography.
