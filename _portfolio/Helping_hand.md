About the project
===
With the goal of developing an assitive technology for severly disabled, we developed a 6-DOF Robotic arm with inverse kinematic controller. To enable user to control the same a pupil tracking algorithm was developed which is used to provide directional and motion command to the hand. As a proof of concept we used it to manipulate a bottle as shown in the image.
